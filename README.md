# Dont-Shoot-I-m-Cute
A game made for "Epihphany GameJam" in a team. Where we needed to make a game in 60 hours. The theme was basically cute; be it, visuals, characters, sounds..etc.

In this game the user controls the mouse to shoot the red monsters that hide behind the cute monsters at regular intervals.

The game is published on the following link:
